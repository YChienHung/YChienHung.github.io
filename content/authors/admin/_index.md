  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm Chein Hung Yang, a MD student in Control Engineering at [VSISLab](www.vsislab.com), School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, advised by Prof. [Wei Zhang](brain.sdu.edu.cn/info/1092/1093.htm) and Researcher [Xiao Jia](faculty.sdu.edu.cn/jiaxiao/zh_CN/index.htm). I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Robot Engineering at Shandong University of Science and Technology. During my undergraduate years, I worked with Prof. [Tao Sui](xindian.sdust.edu.cn/info/1045/1544.htm) and A.P.[Hui Wang](xindian.sdust.edu.cn/info/1032/2446.htm). My research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Medical Image Analysis and Representation Learning. I hope my work can reduce the pain of disease and improve people's happiness.
